# MyCalculationSheet

This is a small project I use to get a first hand on HTML-CSS-Javascript-Bootstrap-jQuery coding and, incidentally, let my 7-years-old daughter exercise (so this is why the webpage is in French).

The webpage currently generates simple arithmetic calculations on request and automatically corrects the answers, using Javascript to reproduce Excel-like color coding: red == false, green == true.
